      Royal Challengers Bangalore Captain: Faf du Plessis Coach: Sanjay Bangar
      Coach: Simon Katich Home ground: M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru IPL
      titles: 0 Owners: Diageo India Private Limited High on the popularity
      charts but with nothing to show for it in their trophy cabinet, Royal
      Challengers Bangalore have been runners-up three times. Bought for Rs 464
      crore (about US$111.6 million), they were the second-most expensive
      franchise in 2008. The team ownership changed hands from Vijay Mallya,
      chairman of United Breweries Limited, to Diageo India in 2015. History The
      team was branded a Test XI in 2008, when they went big on players with
      experience, in the hope that they would adjust quickly to T20 too, but RCB
      managed to only cobble together four wins. The next three seasons,
      however, they turned things around with two runners-up finishes. Over the
      years, the franchise has spent big on some players at the auction - Yuvraj
      Singh (2014), Dinesh Karthik (2015) and Chris Morris (2020) - but they
      have seldom backed these big buys for a second season if they haven’t
      impressed the first time. However, despite their fluctuating fortunes, the
      franchise continued to keep faith in Virat Kohli as captain. In 2021, they
      signed Glenn Maxwell for close to US$2 million. The highs Rahul Dravid and
      Anil Kumble helped RCB rise from near rock bottom in 2008 to runners-up in
      2009. Chris Gayle orchestrated a magic run in 2011, almost single-handedly
      taking them to the final. Similarly, in 2016, Kohli transformed what was
      shaping up to be a mid-table finish into a sensational late dash to the
      final by scoring a record number of runs. The lows In 2008, RCB’s squad,
      heavy on Test veterans, found themselves chasing 223 in their first IPL
      game, and sent in Dravid and Wasim Jaffer, two doyens of red-ball cricket,
      to open. Midway through that season, their CEO, Charu Sharma, was sacked
      after a string of failures, director Martin Crowe resigned, and the
      franchise installed a new set-up. Since 2016, they have changed coaches
      every season. Season by season 2008 - seventh The team lacked depth, and
      the captain, Dravid, seemed under pressure all the time. Tactically they
      had a strong board but they lacked the personnel to challenge tall targets
      or set up scores. They ended a poor seventh, with just four wins in 14
      games. 2009 - runners-up New captain Kevin Pietersen did little to change
      the notion of RCB being slow starters. By the time Kumble took over as
      captain, RCB had lost four games out of six, but he inspired a terrific
      turnaround, and the team made it to the final. Manish Pandey emerged as a
      star, scoring the first century by an Indian in the IPL. 2010 - third RCB
      got to the semi-finals but then faltered against Mumbai Indians in a tall
      chase - though they then dismantled Deccan Chargers, the side they lost to
      in the 2009 final, in a third-place playoff. Robin Uthappa broke through
      with a run of consistent scores this season, but it proved to be his last
      year with the franchise. 2011 - runners-up Daniel Vettori took charge as
      captain but RCB started poorly again, with the batting failing to click.
      Then Gayle came into the side as a replacement for Dirk Nannes and made a
      bruising century against Kolkata Knight Riders, the franchise that
      released him. The top run-maker that year, he took RCB to the final, where
      they were blown away by Chennai Super Kings. 2012 - fifth A topsy-turvy
      season came down to RCB needing a win in their final league game against
      the Deccan Chargers to make the playoffs, but they imploded in a
      low-scoring chase, taken apart by former RCB man Dale Steyn, who took 3
      for 8. Gayle breached the 700-run mark this season and remained their best
      performer. 2013 - fifth Another 700-plus-runs year for Gayle, including
      175 not out against Pune Warriors, the highest individual score in T20
      cricket. The season also marked a shift in leadership, with Kohli taking
      over during the season from Vettori, but the title continued to elude
      Royal Challengers. 2014 - seventh Ray Jennings left as head coach and
      Vettori took his place. In the auction, RCB broke the bank for Yuvraj
      Singh, but he failed to deliver. Kohli had an ordinary season, Gayle
      worse, and RCB struggled, with just five wins. Still, Mitchell Starc’s
      arrival was something of a silver lining, and Yuzvendra Chahal emerged as
      a breakthrough star. 2015 - third Dinesh Karthik was the big-ticket name
      this season, but he made only 141 runs in 11 innings and was promptly
      released. The bowling impressed, with good performances from Chahal,
      Starc, Harshal Patel and S Aravind. The batting continued to revolve
      around Gayle, Kohli and de Villiers, and they couldn’t pull off a win on a
      square turner in the qualifier against CSK. 2016 - runners-up Kohli made a
      little short of 1000 runs in the season, single-handedly turning the
      team’s fortunes around. After racking up five losses in their first seven
      games, they got all the way to the final, where they came up short against
      SRH in a big chase: Gayle and Kohli laid a good platform, but the middle
      order unravelled in the face of intense pressure. 2017 - eighth Miserable
      batting performances defined this dismal year. Kohli, Gayle and de
      Villiers had injury concerns, and the latter two made just 416 runs
      between them at an average of under 25. There was simply too much pressure
      on the middle order, who succumbed. The end result was three wins in 14
      games; the nadir was a 49 all-out against Kolkata Knight Riders. 2018 -
      sixth No Gayle, so Kohli and de Villiers shouldered the run-making
      responsibility and scored 530 and 480 respectively. The next best among
      the middle-order batters was Mandeep Singh, with 252 runs. RCB’s inability
      to zero in on an ideal XI early cost them. They had a small chance of
      qualifying in their final game, against Rajasthan Royals, but crumbled.
      2019 - eighth Kohli took on most of the batting load again, with little
      support from the other batters. Death bowling remained a problem, the
      spinners struggled, and it left RCB with too much to do in the second half
      of the competition. Kohli was vocal about his frustration and helplessness
      and it led to a full overhaul of the coaching staff ahead of the 2020
      season. 2020 - fourth With seven wins in ten games, a top-two finish
      loomed, but they lost the next four games to scramble into the playoffs on
      net run rate. In the eliminator, they ran into their bogey team -
      Sunrisers Hyderabad - and fell short. They ended the tournament with five
      losses on the trot. 2021 - third RCB were within one hit of securing a
      top-two finish, but collapsed against Sunrisers Hyderabad to finish third,
      going into the eliminator, where they came up against a resurgent KKR, who
      had won six of seven games to make it to the top four. RCB lost a tight
      game and Kohli bowed out of the side’s captaincy without a title under his
      belt. Key players Virat Kohli RCB jumped at the opportunity when Delhi
      passed up the chance to acquire the 2008 Under-19 World Cup-winning
      captain. Thirteen years on, Kohli remains the only player in the league to
      have played for only one franchise. In 2016 he scored a record 973 runs,
      with four centuries, to inspire RCB’s run to the final. AB de Villiers He
      joined the franchise in 2011 and became an integral part of the leadership
      group. He kept wicket until 2013, after which back injuries made him give
      up the gloves. He has often had to man an inexperienced middle order along
      with Kohli. When Aaron Finch was introduced into the mix, de Villiers was
      freed up to play the role of a finisher. Chris Gayle Gayle's rise in the
      world of T20 leagues began in the 2011 IPL, when he joined RCB as a
      replacement player. He was the top run scorer in the league that year and
      the next. Back injuries affected his performances towards the latter part
      of his stint, and he was released at the end of the 2017 season - by when
      he had scored 3420 runs for them at a strike rate of just under 155.
      Harshal Patel Patel first played in the IPL for RCB in 2012. But it wasn’t
      until 2021 that he truly made a mark, with a record-equalling 32 wickets
      in the season, which vaulted him into contention for the India side at 31,
      a full 12 years after he first made a mark for India Under-19s. Yuzvendra
      Chahal Having spent three years largely on the fringes at Mumbai Indians,
      Chahal was bought for Rs 10 lakh (about $16,000) in 2014 and went on to
      become RCB’s leading wicket-taker. He was the second-highest wicket-taker
      in the tournament in 2016. Glenn Maxwell Maxwell was offloaded by Punjab
      Kings after IPL 2020, but it hardly diminished his auction value: RCB
      needed to go hard in a fierce bidding war to get him. Having finally
      signed him, they batted him at No. 4 consistently, and he delivered
      blockbuster returns, making 513 runs at a strike rate of 144.10 in 2021,
      his best IPL season since 2014.
